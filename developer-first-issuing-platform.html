      <h5><a href="https://www.kunle.app/feb-2020-permissionless-issuing.html" target="_blank">The default banking-as-a-service platform will be developer-first üîó</a></h5>
      <p><strong>The developer-first default</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The default addresses most developer use cases from the very beginning</li>
        <li>For the use cases that the default doesn't solve, either the developers won't need them at their current state, or those are something that they can build for themselves</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Examples of default businesses</strong></p>
      <ul>
          <li>Starting an online store ‚Üí Shopify</li>
          <li>Collecting payments ‚Üí Stripe</li>
          <li>Sending SMS ‚Üí Twilio</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The value of becoming a developer-first default in fintech</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fintech is becoming embedded within software products</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Shopify's merchant payments (using Stripe)</li>
            <li>The Uber Card</li>
            <li>Lyft's Direct Debit Card</li>
          </ul>
        <li>High retention, engagement, and switching costs</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Example: When a checking account is issued to an engaged customer:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Salary is deposited to the account</li>
                <li>Bills are linked to and being paid through it</li>
                <li>The card is being used for purchases</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        <li>Switching to a new instrument requires high motivation, ability, and effort i.e. re-linking bills, updating cards, accounts and routing, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Issuer-Processors and Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) providers</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Issues cards</li>
        <li>Assigns card numbers</li>
        <li>Processes card payments</li>
        <li>Maintains cardholder name/dob, among others</li>
        <li>Sometimes manages balances</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The current state of card or bank account issuing</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A customer still needs to fill up forms and talk to people i.e. sales before getting an API</li>
        <li>Issuer-processors and BaaS providers are mostly driven by sales</li>
        <li>Customers realize too late that the the BaaS platform they selected are not right for them. At the point when contracts were already signed, deliverables are already embedded to the customer's goals, implementation is under way, and product trade-offs are made.</li>
        <li>Issuers lose customers when switching Issuer-Processing / ACH processing platforms since they also have to switch the account / routing issued to a customer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why a developer-first card issuing platform still doesn't exist</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>High risk - A bank is needed to issue a card. An unknown entity that issues a financial instrument (and funds and transacts on that) poses a high amount of regulatory and financial risk for a bank e.g. the entity issuing a card to a bad actor can put the bank's business at risk.</li>
        <li>Large fixed costs - Sales and account management teams lead to high fixed costs (recurring). Most issuer-processors / BaaS platforms pass these costs to their customers. These costs are high enough to become barriers for startups and developers to get started.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Use cases</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engineers can issue a card over the weekend or during hackathons, with less risk and potentially eliminating the need for a BD person.</li>
        <li>Startup companies can easily issue a card.</li>
        <li>Neobanks can start and scale a second stack to:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Load balance</li>
            <li>Add redundancy</li>
            <li>Add business continuity</li>
            <li>Ensure that their primary bank/processor stack competes on economics and quality</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Legacy banks can conduct low-cost, low-risk experiments. The reduced cost can then be passed to consumers through lower fees (if not eliminating them entirely).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Become the default way to issue cards / bank accounts for developers</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developer-first onboarding - A developer can issue, fund, and transact on a card / bank account prior to talking with anyone from your company</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Go-to-market strategy for issuer-processors or BaaS platforms</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sell better to customers</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Have a sales team that is better than the competition at finding and selling to banks or issuer fintechs that want to either switch to or add a new BaaS platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Be less expensive for customers</li>
        <ul>
          <li>You should financially cost less for banks and issuer fintechs to onboard with and use</li>
          <li>Your basic services should be inexpensive and configurable</li>
          <li>Charge add-ons w/ fee per account per month</li>
          <li>The bank / issuer fintech should be able to optimize their costs through the fees they want to pay by making them choose:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>What services they want to use</li>
            <li>What costs they can pass on to consumers</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Be easier to use for customers</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Make it easy for developers to use</li>
          <li>The API interface should be simple enough for a developer to use end-to-end without talking to a human being, making it easy to write a program.</li>
          <li>A bank or issuer fintech can evaluate the product first, align internally, before talking to you.</li>
          <li>Banks and issuer fintechs should be able to try try your BaaS platform without incurring the biggest cost:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Getting the organization aligned</li>
            <li>Getting the necessary operating and engineering resources to support a new bank stack</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Attributes of a developer-first, issuing platform</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A developer should be able to do the following before talking to anyone on your team:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Sign up</li>
          <li>Verify their identity</li>
          <li>Get API access</li>
          <li>Issue and transact on a limited number of cards / bank accounts</li>
        </ul>
        <li>To satisfy the bank's requirements:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The API should encode everything the developer needs to set i.e.:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The developer's identity and acceptance of agreements</li>
            <li>The card holder's identity and acceptance of agreements</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>The API should request and verify additional information i.e. IDs, selfie without the need for a separate integration with a KYC provider</li>
        <li>A developer can transact up to certain limit, and can provide additional information to lift the limit programatically:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Limit the number of cards than can be issued</li>
            <li>Each card can only do a max number of transactions per week</li>
            <li>There is a per-transaction limit and total transaction volume limit</li>
          </ul>
         <li>A low-cost starting point: default card, bank, and usage configuration that serves as a low-cost starting point</li> 
         <li>Customizable card design (gets more custom at scale)</li>
         <p><strong>Power law dynamics</strong></p>
         <ul>
           <li>To embed power law dynamics, you need to become the low-cost, default card issuer or BaaS provider that is developer-first, allowing customers to experiment with card issuing</li>
           <li>Power law is then triggered once customers start generating billions in transaction volume</li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Meta-bins and meta-routing numbers: Why are they needed?</strong></p>
         <ul>
           <li>Banks, issuer-processors, and BaaS providers have leverage over card issuers</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The banks</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Own the bin and routing number</li>
                  <li>Directly interface with Visa and Mastercard</li>
                </ul>
              <li>The issuer-processors and BaaS providers</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Manage the BIN on behalf of the bank</li>
                  <li>Assign sub-BIN ranges to customers that want to issue cards</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
           <li>If a card issuer with millions of customers wants to change their bank (portfolio migration), issuer-processor, or BaaS provider, they have to resend millions of new cards to their customers. To do that:</li>
           <ul>
             <li>The card issuer will pay the costs of creating and shipping the cards, along with other resources without adding to revenue</li>
             <li>Customers have to accept a new agreements, activate the card, and re-link them to all the relevant places i.e. Netflix, Spotify</li>
           </ul>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Meta-bins and meta-routing numbers: What will they look like?</strong></p>
         <ul>
           <li>Make BINs portable</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Revisit the rule that BINs can only be owned by banks that are principal members in Visa and Mastercard</li>
            </ul>
           <li>The meta-bin</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A BIN range owned by the issuer and managed by the issuer-processor or BaaS provider</li>
              <li>With the meta-bin, the issuer can do a portfolio migration without resending cards to customers</li>
              <li>Visa or Mastercard could then direct incoming authorization traffic and settlement messages to the issuer-processor or BaaS provider selected by the issuer</li>
              <li>The meta-bin lessens the negative impact to cardholders when an issuer changes banks, issuer-processors, or BaaS providers</li>
            </ul>
           <li>The meta-routing number</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Owned by the issuer</li>
              <li>Similar to the meta-bin, cardholders don't have to enter a new account / routing number when the issuer changes their bank</li>
            </ul>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Which comes first?</strong></p>
         <ul>
           <li>Make it easy to start issuing cards and bank accounts by creating a developer-first issuing platform</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An organizational design problem</li>
              <li>BaaS platforms already have the technical foundations to do this</li>
              <li>BaaS platforms have to convince bank partners that this is worth doing</li>
            </ul>
           <li>Make it easy for issuers to change banks, issuer-processors, and BaaS providers by creating a meta-bin and meta-routing platform</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A business innovation problem</li>
              <li>There is a material technical challenge because this is a new concept</li>
              <li>Convince the credit card networks that this should exist</li>
              <li>Get traction and from the developer-first platform and use that to convince Visa and Mastercard that this should be done</li>
            </ul>
         </ul>
      </ul>
